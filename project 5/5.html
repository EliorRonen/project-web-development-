            <h2>the orgins of theme parks:</h2>
            <p>The amusement park evolved from traditions in the European Middle Ages. An amusement park is a contemporary arrangement,
            designed to combine components of a fair, carnival, and theme park. An early example of an amusement park is the
            Bartholomew Fair.[9] By the 18th and 19th centuries, they had evolved into places of entertainment for the masses, where
            the public could view freak shows, acrobatics, conjuring, and juggling, take part in competitions and walk through
            menageries.
            
            A wave of innovation in the 1860s and 1870s created mechanical rides, such as the steam-powered carousel (built by
            Thomas Bradshaw, at the Aylsham Fair), and its derivatives, notably from Frederick Savage of King's Lynn, Norfolk whose
            fairground machinery was exported all over the world; his "galloping horses" innovation is seen in carousels today.[10]
            This inaugurated the era of the modern funfair ride, as the working classes were increasingly able to spend their
            surplus wages on entertainment.[11]
            
            The second influence was the pleasure garden. Bakken ("The Hill"), the world's oldest amusement park, opened in mainland
            Europe in 1583. It is located north of Copenhagen in Klampenborg, Denmark.[12][13]
            
            Another example is early garden was the Vauxhall Gardens, founded in 1661, in London. By the late 18th century, the site
            had an admission fee for its many attractions. It regularly drew enormous crowds, with its paths often noted for
            romantic assignations; tightrope walkers, hot air balloon ascents, concerts and fireworks providing amusement. Although
            the gardens were originally designed for the elites, they soon became places of great social diversity. Public firework
            displays were put on at Marylebone Gardens, and Cremorne Gardens offered music, dancing, and animal acrobatics
            displays.[14]
            
            Prater, located in Vienna, Austria, began as a royal hunting ground which was opened in 1766 for public enjoyment. There
            followed coffee-houses and caf√©s, which led to the beginnings of the Wurstelprater as an amusement park.
            
            The concept of a fixed park for amusement was further developed with the beginning of the world's fairs. The first World
            fair began in 1851 with the construction of the landmark Crystal Palace in London, England. The purpose of the
            exposition was to celebrate the industrial achievement of the nations of the world and it was designed to educate and
            entertain the visitors.[15]
            
            
            The original Ferris Wheel at the World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago in 1893
            In the United States, cities and businesses also saw the world's fair as a way of demonstrating economic and industrial
            success.[15] The World's Columbian Exposition of 1893 in Chicago, Illinois was an early precursor to the modern
            amusement park. The fair was an enclosed site, that merged entertainment, engineering and education to entertain the
            masses. It set out to bedazzle the visitors, and successfully did so with a blaze of lights from the "White City."[2] To
            make sure that the fair was a financial success, the planners included a dedicated amusement concessions area called the
            Midway Plaisance.[15] Rides from this fair captured the imagination of the visitors and of amusement parks around the
            world, such as the first steel Ferris wheel, which was found in many other amusement areas, such as the Prater by 1896.
            Also, the experience of the enclosed ideal city with wonder, rides, culture and progress (electricity), was based on the
            creation of an illusory place.[2]
            
            The "midway" introduced at the Columbian Exposition would become a standard part of most amusement parks, fairs,
            carnivals, and circuses. The midway contained not only the rides, but other concessions and entertainments such as
            shooting galleries, penny arcades, games of chance, and shows.[16]</p>
